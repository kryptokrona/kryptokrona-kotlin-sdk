Kryptokrona is a decentralized blockchain from the Nordic based on CryptoNote, which forms the basis for Monero, among others. CryptoNote is a so-called “application layer” protocol further developed by TurtleCoin that enables things like: private transactions, messages and arbitrary data storage, completely decentralized.

Kryptokrona SDK for Kotlin is currently the most fully featured implementation of the Kryptokrona Network protocols and includes many useful components and tools for building decentralized private communication and payment systems.
